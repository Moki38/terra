# Simply connect the red wire to 5V power, black to ground, yellow wire to your i2c data pin, and the white wire to the i2c clock pin. 
# You cannot change the i2c address so only one sensor per i2c bus. 
# Two ~10Kohm pullup resistors are required for use, connect from the SDA and SCL lines to the power wire.
